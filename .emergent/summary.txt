The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a MetaDesign clone into Smari Creatives, establishing core functionalities like a split-screen, custom cursors, and parallax. Initial work involved fixing a  display issue in  and organizing the . The primary focus then shifted to the iterative development of the Work page (, ). This involved replicating designs, implementing a fixed red sidebar, integrating a video background, and meticulously refining project card layouts. The card layout evolved significantly from a simple grid to a complex arrangement of large, divided, and medium cards, with content moving from overlays to below the cards. Recent efforts concentrated on adjusting card sizes, optimizing spacing, and ensuring precise alignment. The trajectory concludes with the elimination of all small cards (medium cards) and the removal of the Call to Action section, simplifying the page layout to only large and divided cards. The AI engineer consistently ran backend tests and took screenshots to verify changes throughout the process.

<product_requirements>
The product's initial goal was to super clone metadesign.com/en, focusing on visual fidelity including a red/black split-screen, specific typography, navigation, logo, headlines, and a detailed footer.
Subsequent enhancements included:
1.  **Frontend Design Refinement:** Comprehensive visual and interactive testing.
2.  **Advanced Interactive Features:** Integration of custom cursors, typewriter effects, scroll-triggered animations, page transitions, and parallax.
3.  **Footer Enhancements:** Redesigned for increased height, mobile responsiveness, removal of specific sections, and a black background on the left.
4.  **Rebranding:** Application renamed to Smari Creatives.
5.  **Video Carousel Integration:** Dynamic, full-overlay video carousel replaced static homepage content.
6.  **Work Page Replication & Enhancement:**
    *   Replicate MetaDesign's Work page, preserving aesthetics.
    *   Implement a fixed, responsive red sidebar (initially 1/4, then 1/3, finally 1/6 width, 100vh height).
    *   Integrate an auto-playing, muted, looping video background in the main content.
    *   Dynamically size project cards, evolving through various dimensions (e.g., 1600x900px, 1400x600px).
    *   Implement various alternating layouts including large landscape, two medium cards, divided cards, and eventually focusing only on large/divided cards.
    *   Move project titles, client/year, descriptions, and tag pills from card overlays to *below* each card, with specific alignment and increased font sizes.
    *   Adjust Our Work title: reduced top margin, left-aligned, bold.
    *   Ensure red sidebar does not float over the footer and full device responsiveness, with content respecting sidebar boundaries.
    *   Eliminate all small (medium) cards.
    *   Remove the Call to Action section.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on a series of significant layout modifications to the Work page (). The work progressed as follows:
1.  **Card Size and Alignment Refinement:** Following an initial request to make small cards (medium-sized project cards) display 3 per row and ensure titles were seen, the AI further enhanced spacing and alignment. This involved increasing grid gaps (), adding horizontal padding (), and refining card/text positioning with classes like , , , and .
2.  **Portfolio Expansion:** The user requested add more work, leading the AI to expand the number of projects displayed on the Work page by increasing the mock data.
3.  **Large Card Reduction and Medium Card Enlargement:** The user requested remove some of the big cards and leave ony 2 from top then also reduce on their height, make the small cards also bigger. This involved reducing the number of large cards from an alternating pattern to just two (first and one in the middle) and decreasing their height from 900px to 600px. Concurrently, medium cards were increased from  to .
4.  **Further Medium Card Scaling:** The user then requested to increase on the size of the small cards again x2 which led to medium cards being scaled from  to , and then again with make the three small cards bigger to .
5.  **Large Card Division:** The user requested from the big cards duplicate them and from each card divide by 2 and keep the sizes equal. This transformed the existing two large cards (1400px x 600px) into four equal-sized cards (700px x 600px each), appearing in sets of two.
6.  **Addition of New Large Cards:** The user then requested then also make for me other 2 whole big cards, which added two more full-width large cards (1400px x 600px) into the layout.
7.  **Top Large Card Placement:** The user asked to put one of the big cards first at the top, which repositioned one of the large cards to be the very first element on the Work page.
8.  **Elimination of Medium Cards:** The user explicitly stated eliminate all the 3 small cards, leading the AI to remove all sections displaying the  medium cards, streamlining the layout to only include large and divided cards.
9.  **Call to Action (CTA) Section Removal:** The final explicit request was to Call to Action Section, remove that section. The AI successfully located and removed the entire CTA block from , ensuring a clean transition from the portfolio content directly to the footer.

All frontend changes were verified with screenshots, and backend tests were consistently run to ensure no regressions. The current state is a Work page that showcases projects exclusively through large full-width and equal-sized divided cards, without any medium-sized cards or a concluding CTA section.
